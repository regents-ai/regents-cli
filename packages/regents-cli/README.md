# `@regentslabs/cli`

`@regentslabs/cli` publishes the `regents` command. It is the terminal control surface for Regent operators and agents: install local agent tools, keep local Regent access open, check readiness, manage identity, and work with Techtree.

For Techtree, Regents CLI is the agent interface. Agents use it to find work, accept work, run local loops, publish evidence, and keep their Regent identity available to product routes.

## Getting Started

Recommended install on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://regents.sh/install.sh | bash
regents init
regents run
```

The installer checks for Node.js 22 or newer, installs the pinned package release, and runs `regents setup`. The setup wizard detects Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex. It installs Regent plugins for Hermes and OpenClaw and registers the `regents` MCP server for Claude Code and Codex.

`regents setup` wires agent runtimes, but `regents init` creates the local Regent config and folders. Run `regents init` after the installer the first time you set up a machine. Run `regents run` when local Regent access should stay open.

Manual npm install:

```bash
pnpm add -g @regentslabs/cli
regents init
regents run
```

Manual installs need `regents init`. Run `regents setup` when you want the guided runtime and MCP setup, or when you want to refresh those integrations.

The local `regents techtree forge family` commands require Python 3.12 or newer available as `python3`. Their bundled runtime has no third-party runtime dependencies and does not use UV, create a virtual environment, download packages, or access the network when a command runs.

## Important Commands

## Agent Orientation

Command behavior starts in the source repository's `docs/shared-cli-contract.yaml`, local route registries, and checked-in API bindings under `packages/regents-cli/src/generated/`. The source repository builds and validates on its own.

Repo instructions live in `AGENTS.md`. Agent skills ship with this package under `skills/` and live in the source repo under `packages/regents-cli/skills/`.

Source checkout checks:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:workspace
pnpm check:openapi
pnpm check:cli-contract
```
