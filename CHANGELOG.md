# Changelog

All notable changes to `@regentslabs/cli` should be recorded here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Bare `regents` now prints a short readiness summary (local runtime, wallet, identity, saved sign-ins, and Fold state when active) and points to `regents --help`.
- `regents init` is now a guided, re-runnable setup: it writes the local config, installs the missing Hermes/OpenClaw Regent tools, starts local Regent access in the background, runs the runtime doctor checks, and prints the remaining wallet and identity steps. Re-running it when everything is set up reports ready.
- `regents doctor --fix` is now part of the shared CLI contract. It applies only safe local repairs: create the default config, create missing runtime folders, remove a validated stale runtime socket, and create the default XMTP policy file.
- Failed commands now print `Next: <step>` from the command's contract next_step metadata through the shared error path.
- `regents identity graph` now shows the saved agent identity, product-owned links when available, and chain-owner checks for the identity token.
- Added bundled Regents agent skills for Regents, Platform, Autolaunch, and Techtree.
- Added `regents setup skills` to install those skills through the Agent Skills installer.
- Added a package install note that points users to `regents setup skills`.
- Added the local runtime front door: `regents plugin install --runtime auto`, `regents setup --runtime auto`, `regents runtime status|tools|policy`, and richer `regents run --fold ...` guidance.
- Added Agentic Wallet commands under `regents wallet agentic ...`, keeping it separate from the Regent identity wallet.
- Added local Regent budgets with `regents budget grant|status|ledger|revoke`.
- Added guarded x402 entry points with `regents x402 search` and `regents x402 pay ... --budget ... --max-usdc ...`.
- Added local receipts with `regents receipt create|get|list|share-draft`.

### Changed

- `--runtime` now defaults to `auto` for `regents setup`, `regents plugin install`, `regents plugin status`, and `regents plugin doctor`, so the flag is optional.
- Fold proof now uses `regents techtree fold proof --attempt <attempt-id>` and stays anchored to existing Techtree benchmark attempts.
- Fold copy now describes a reporting/readiness layer over attempts, notebook publications, receipts, and verifier evidence, not a separate Fold run or certificate system.
- Plugin setup owns Hermes/OpenClaw instruction skills; Fold no longer presents skill installation as its own product step.
- Plugin setup now has one install path: `regents plugin install --runtime auto`. Setup reports readiness and next steps instead of writing plugin files.
- Kept the useful Hermes bridge lessons in the current plugin path: runtime agents do not choose wallet providers, identity or wallet changes require explicit approval, and agents call Regent through named tools rather than raw commands.
- Updated the x402 package pin so packed installs use the exported payment client paths required by the CLI.

### Removed

- Removed the positional/`--run` Fold proof shape from the current shipped command surface.
- Removed the old standalone `hermes-regents` bridge. The current Hermes and OpenClaw bridge is installed by Regents CLI.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added `regents agent-context`, a JSON command surface that exposes shipped commands, command groups, command metadata, examples, output behavior, and safe local profile/config summaries for agents.
- Added global `--no-input` handling through a shared prompt boundary so automated runs fail with actionable errors instead of waiting for terminal input.
- Added the Feynman bridge: `regents feynman ...` launches the installed Feynman research shell while keeping Feynman's own setup and state.
- Added Techtree benchmark capsule, run, reliability, repeat, materialize, submit, and scoreboard command coverage.
- Added workspace release checks, workspace manifest validation, packed-install checks, and wallet-action schema validation.

### Changed

- Hard-cut read-style commands to conventional names, including `config get`, `agent profile get`, `runtime get`, `work get`, `regent-staking get`, `xmtp policy get`, and Autolaunch `get` commands.
- Expanded generated CLI command metadata so contracts, help, route checks, command docs, and `agent-context` use the same command source.
- Updated Techtree defaults and tests for Base mainnet-oriented publishing and identity flows.
- Updated Autolaunch subject and holdings commands around canonical prepared wallet actions.
- Improved terminal panel wrapping for narrow terminal widths while keeping JSON output plain for automation.

### Fixed

- Fixed release checks so banned command verbs, missing examples, missing JSON declarations, missing route coverage, and unbounded list/search-style commands fail in contract validation.
- Fixed Techtree benchmark transaction preparation to use typed chain data and canonical wallet-action shapes.
- Fixed staking and Autolaunch transaction paths to use the current prepared transaction envelope.
- Refreshed Platform, Autolaunch, Techtree, and Regent services generated bindings from the current contracts.

### Removed

- Removed prompt-only staking receiver confirmation; prepared wallet actions plus `--submit` are now the explicit value movement boundary.
- Removed old public command names and stale command docs from the shipped CLI surface.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Added Regent work commands for creating work, starting runs, watching run events, and connecting local worker agents.
- Added Platform-facing agent commands for Hermes, OpenClaw, agent links, execution pools, formation status, formation doctor, projection, and runtime operations.
- Added Techtree Science Tasks, BBH draft, BBH run, Autoskill, reviewer, certificate, watch, chatbox, and guided `techtree start` flows.
- Added Regent staking commands for account views, staking, unstaking, claiming USDC, claiming Regent rewards, and claiming plus restaking.
- Added reporting commands for bug and security reports from the CLI.
- Added structured product request logging, transport doctor checks, route contract coverage, and packed-install release checks.
- Added generated CLI command metadata from the YAML contracts so shipped commands, help, and release checks use the same command list.
- XMTP group management now covers the full operator path from the CLI. Agents and humans can view group members, view current group rules, change group rules, view admins and super admins, add or remove admins and super admins, and remove group members.

### Changed

- Split large command and runtime areas into focused modules: command routing, Autolaunch commands, Techtree runtime handlers, Techtree clients, XMTP runtime helpers, doctor checks, and terminal presenters.
- Moved CLI configuration to explicit service base URLs for SIWA, Platform, Autolaunch, and Techtree.
- Replaced duplicated product request helpers with a shared product HTTP client and a shared Base contract client.
- Refreshed generated OpenAPI bindings for Platform, Autolaunch, Techtree, and shared Regent services.
- Aligned shared SIWA signing and audience handling across auth, doctor, Techtree, Autolaunch, Platform, Regent staking, Agentbook, and reports.
- Improved human terminal output for status, doctor, Techtree, Autolaunch, Regent staking, Agentbook, and work-runtime flows while preserving JSON output for scripts.
- Made command tests run serially with realistic timeouts because the CLI suite uses global mocks, local sockets, and local HTTP servers.
- XMTP group commands now reject bad inputs before trying the action. Unsupported rule names, unsupported policy names, and metadata values passed to the wrong rule now fail immediately with clearer feedback.

### Fixed

- Fixed Techtree command contract drift for id-taking commands such as `techtree node get <id>`, `techtree watch <id>`, and `techtree star <id>`.
- Fixed route and command metadata checks so exact shipped command names must match the route table.
- Fixed product service URL selection so Platform, Autolaunch, Techtree, and shared Regent service calls use their configured owners.
- Fixed chatbox stream failures so failed streams surface as failures instead of being hidden.
- Made runtime state, XMTP state, and local secure writes safer under repeated command runs.
- Removed stale JavaScript doctor files and other old-shape handling that no longer matches the current contracts.

### Removed

- Removed older public-beta Autolaunch command paths and compatibility routes that are not part of the current contracts.
- Removed duplicated shared-services request code in favor of the shared product HTTP client.
- Removed stale command metadata that omitted required positional ids.
